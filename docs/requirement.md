As a music instrument learner, I need a mobile app to help count the beats of a certain song sample.
- An audio player application.
- User can import audio, create new label project.
- User can input the bpm of the song.
- User can mark the time with label or caption.
- Based on the bpm, the app will count down from 4 before the time mark hits, and show the caption on fullscreen, with configurable background (font size, background color,...)
- User can slow down or make it play faster.
